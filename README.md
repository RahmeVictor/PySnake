# PySnake
A very old project (August 2018) made to learn more about OOP.

It features mazes, levels and even a little rat! It does not use the best coding practices, but I have learned a lot from it, especially about OOP and keeping a clean and readable code. It's mostly complete, however the code needs to be rewritten in a much cleaner way.
